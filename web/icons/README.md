# App Icons

The following icon files should be placed in this directory for a complete web app experience:

- `Icon-192.png` - 192x192px app icon
- `Icon-512.png` - 512x512px app icon
- `Icon-maskable-192.png` - 192x192px maskable icon
- `Icon-maskable-512.png` - 512x512px maskable icon

These icons will be used when the app is installed as a PWA on mobile devices.

**Note:** The app will work fine without these icons, they just enhance the experience when adding to home screen on iOS/Android.

For the synthwave theme, consider creating icons with:
- Deep purple background (#0A0A1F or #1A1A2E)
- Neon pink "L" or book symbol (#FF00FF)
- Glowing effect around the icon
